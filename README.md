# Autocomplete-PowerShell-WinServer2022

This package provides PowerShell Module Autocompletions for Windows Server 2022.

This package relies on the `autocomplete-powershell` Service in order to provide these autocompletions.
That means that to use this package, you **must** first install [`autocomplete-powershell`](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/autocomplete-powershell).

Once that package is successfully installed, you'll be able to install this package and gain access to all these new autocompletions.

The autocompletions provided are generated directly from [Windows-PowerShell-Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/tree/main).
